/******************************************************************
Stylesheet: IE Stylesheet
Here, we import all the styles the standard stylesheet gets, only without the media queries.
******************************************************************/


// Remember, all the BASE styles are called already since IE can read those. Below, we need to import only the stuff IE can't 
// understand (what's inside the media queries). We also need to import the mixins file so LESS can understand the variables.
@import "mixins";
@import "481up";
@import "grid";
@import "768up";
@import "1030up";



/******************************************************************
ADDITIONAL IE FIXES
These fixes are now ONLY seen by IE, so you don't have to worry about using prefixes.

/*
For example, you can use something like:
.no-textshadow .class { ... }

You can also target specific versions by using the classes applied to the html element.
These can sometimes change, so take a look inside the header.php file to see what they are:
.lt-ie8 .class { ... }
